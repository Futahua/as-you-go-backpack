 * receive type chips; All is shown whenever there is at least one result; and an active filter that loses
 * all matches falls back to All immediately.

/**
 * Section 0.6's pinned normalization, and the only copy of it in the tree.
 *
 * It lives here, in the module every other Quick Run module already imports, because both the search
 * rows (normalizedName) and the query path need it — and a second copy would be exactly the drift the
 * contract's "pin a single normalization function" forbids. Unicode NFKC, tone-fold, case-fold, trim,
 * collapse repeated whitespace: the comparison is normalized, never the string shown.
 *
 * Tone-folding is a decided product rule, not a nicety. Quick Run's promise is hotkey, type, Enter, gone,
 * so composing a tone mark to find something you are about to open is friction at the exact moment the
 * feature exists to remove: someone searching their own items already knows what they are called, and is
 * locating rather than spelling. Tones therefore come off BOTH sides of the comparison, and so does case.
 * đ folds to d by the creator's own request.
 *
 * What folding must never do is change which base letter a Vietnamese reader sees. Only marks are removed
 * — the tone, the horn in ơ/ư, the breve in ă, the circumflex in â — plus the stroke in đ, which is a
 * letter's own shape rather than a mark and is named in the ruling. Nothing is transliterated: bài does
 * not answer to "pai", and the length of the string in base letters is preserved. This is a search
 * convenience and never a rewrite: the names shown stay exactly as the state stores them.
