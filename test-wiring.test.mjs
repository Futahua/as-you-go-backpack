// The wiring guard: a test file that no script runs is a test that will rot.
//
// This exists because the repository had three of them. `card-implementation.test.mjs`,
// `compact-card-parity.test.mjs` and `picker-keyboard-routing.test.mjs` all sat in the tree, all read the
// entry file to assert surface behaviour, and none of them was named by any test script — so nothing ran
// them and nothing noticed. Running them by hand showed why that matters: the picker one passes, and the
// other two fail, on markup and CSS that later work moved.
//
// The two failing files are named below rather than wired in, because wiring them would turn the suite red
// without answering the question they raise: is the test stale or did the surface regress? That is a
// creator eye-check, not a guess, and `EYE-TEST-PROBLEMS.md` is where those are recorded. Naming them here
// keeps them visible instead of invisible, and stops a fourth file joining them unnoticed.
