 * and collision as every icon, and what the user sees is a curve drawn through
 * where those nodes ended up.
 *
 * That inversion is the whole design, and it makes free what the previous
 * approach could not achieve at all. Computing an envelope means solving for a
 * shape that is smooth, closed, connected and of even thickness — four
 * properties that fight each other, and that a session of grid sampling,
 * contour extraction and morphological closing never got right at once. A
 * chain of linked nodes has all four by construction: it is continuous because
 * the links hold, smooth because the link distance is even, the same thickness
 * everywhere because it is made of identical nodes, and closed because the
 * chain loops.
 *
 * The behaviours asked for follow from ordinary physics rather than rules:
 *
 * - Push a member into the ring and it dents inward, because the ring nodes
 *   are pushed by the same collision that separates icons.
 * - Pull a member outward and the ring stretches to follow, growing new links
 *   as its perimeter grows — "as big as needed" is literally more nodes.
 * - An outsider cannot get in and a member cannot get out, because the ring
 *   nodes collide with icons like anything else. Containment is a consequence,
 *   not something enforced.
 * - Two sets overlap by their rings crossing, which needs no special case.
 *
 * No DOM, store, or browser APIs. */

/** The ellipse that encloses these members, oriented along how they are spread.
 *
 * A circle has one radius and so no way to express direction: dragging two
 * members apart along one axis inflates the boundary on both. Measured, two
 * 72px tiles 800px apart gave a ring 982px tall, when it should have stayed
 * about 112 — the set ballooned across the drag instead of stretching along it.
 *
 * The orientation comes from the members' own covariance, so the long axis is
 * whichever way they actually lie rather than a fixed one. A single member, or
 * several stacked in a perfect line, degenerates to a circle, which is right:
 * there is no spread to point along.
 *
 * The ellipse must reach one way without reaching the other. Growing each axis
 * by the worst member, symmetrically around the members' mean, makes a
 * diagonally dragged outlier extend the boundary backward as much as forward —
 * measured, a 240px drag swept the opposite side 113px outward and enclosed
 * foreign items there. So, while a member is being dragged (anchored), each
 * axis is sized by the member demand on EACH side separately: the semi-axis
 * spans half the two sides' demands (floored at the covariance estimate, which
 * keeps a settled set's natural size), and the centre shifts toward the
 * outlier by half the imbalance. The side opposite the outlier then sits
 * exactly at the stationary members' extent plus padding, and stays there
 * however far the drag goes.
 *
 * When nothing is held the ellipse returns to the symmetric mean-centred form.
 * The shift is only stable while the outlier is pinned: if the ring's centre
 * chased the members' own drift (no drag), the ring's collide shell would
 * sweep free members outward — measured, the always-heated ring settle runs
 * away with a shifted centre, and holds with the symmetric one. Dragging is
 * exactly the case that needs the one-sided shape, so the two behaviours are
 * the same code path with the anchor flag.

/** The shortest valid escape from a trespassed region: the nearest point that
 * is outside every forbidden hull while still inside every allowed hull, and
 * the direction to it.
 *
 * A trespasser must leave the sets it does not belong to without being thrown
 * out of the sets it does. The nearest such point is what the response aims
 * at; the direction alone is not enough, because a shortest direction found by
 * sampling a candidate list can be far from optimal for a UNION of hulls: a
 * minimax compromise direction between two overlapping hulls beats every
 * individual edge normal and nearest-exit direction (a seeded audit found a
 * 2.30x case, preserved as a regression fixture).
 *
 * So the answer is computed on the geometry instead of searched over
 * directions. The valid region's boundary is made of pieces of the forbidden
 * hulls' edges: leaving the forbidden union means reaching its exposed
 * boundary — a part of some forbidden edge that is not buried inside another
 * forbidden hull. Every forbidden edge is therefore split at its intersections
 * with the other forbidden hulls and with the allowed hulls, each resulting
 * interval is classified once by its midpoint (outside every OTHER forbidden
 * hull, inside every allowed hull), and `point` is projected onto the surviving
 * intervals. The nearest projection is the exact optimum: the closest point of
 * the valid set lies on that set's boundary, and its boundary is exactly the
 * union of those intervals (plus allowed-hull boundary pieces, which are never
 * strictly better — a point there is also on a forbidden edge or already
 * outside). Allowed-hull edges are split and tested the same way so a corridor
 * that runs along the allowed boundary is still found.
 *
 * Returns { x, y, distance } — the unit direction to that nearest valid point
 * and its distance — or null when the point is already outside every forbidden
 * hull, or when no valid point exists (the allowed region is entirely buried in
 * forbidden territory). */

/** Caps how far any node may travel in a single tick.

 * Registered after the other forces so it sees their combined effect: it is a
 * governor on the result, not another opinion about where things should go.
 *
 * Dragging several foreign items through a set at once is what needs it. Each
 * one pushes the members, the members drag the ring after them, and with four
 * in flight the feedback compounds — measured, the ring went from moving 0.3px
 * per tick when settled to 17.5px on average and 164px in a single tick, which
 * is the violent convulsing seen on screen. Nothing there is wrong
 * individually; it is the sum that explodes.
 *
 * A cap is the honest fix rather than weakening any one force, because the
 * problem is the total. 8px per tick is roughly half a tile at 60fps: fast
 * enough that the boundary still keeps up with a dragged member — measured,
 * members are flung 70px from home against 455 uncapped — and slow enough that
 * nothing can cross the screen in a frame.
