/**
 * Quick Run — what Enter means, as a plan rather than a launch.
 *
 * Section 1.5 fixes the default actions and this module only decides which one applies and what it needs;
 * nothing here launches, navigates or focuses anything. That split is deliberate: the workspace already
 * owns the execution paths — the keyboard controller handles workspace.open-selection for Enter — and
 * section 1.6's own note says Quick Run must take those keys over only while its input surface is active.
 * So a plan names **the command the workspace already has**, plus the target ids the row already carries,
 * and a caller that has those commands can run it without a second launch implementation.
 *
 * The layout-item case is the one that is not autonomous work: activating and focusing a live foreign
 * application window (restoring it if minimized) is not reversible by a commit, so the plan reports it as
 * deferred with the reason instead of pretending it is ready. A caller that sees deferred must not
 * silently do nothing; the box that owns it waits for a session with the creator at the machine.
 *
 * Shift+Enter (add to the active layout) used to live here and has been CUT, not repaired. Its only write
 * path was `store.replace()`, which installs state in memory while `commit()`/`save()` is what persists it;
 * where this surface lacks document-write authority `replace()` can refuse and hand back the old state
 * without throwing, and the binding would still have said "added" and closed. A false success that loses the
 * write is worse than a missing gesture, so the gesture is gone: no plan, no notice, no key. See
 * `papers/quick-run.md` for the cut note.
