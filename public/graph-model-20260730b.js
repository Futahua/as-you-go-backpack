 * Updates folder hues from their original position mapping and set hues from

 * projects every pair within FOLDER_DISTANCE apart until no pair is closer
 * than MIN_HUE_SEPARATION. Pair traversal alternates forward/reverse between
 * passes to reduce solver-order bias; ties use a deterministic direction.
 * Hues stay floating-point (CSS hsl() accepts fractional degrees). When a
 * dense neighborhood cannot keep MIN_HUE_SEPARATION (its proximity graph needs
 * more than eight colors), the affected component is re-colored with the fewest
 * slots that work, for an effective minimum separation of 360 / slotCount.
 *
 * `folders` is an array of { id, x, y }; `colors` is the id -> displayed hue
 * map. `hueState` is session-only set state: callers keep it alive while a set
 * may disappear and reappear, and never persist it.

/** Every pair of entities closer than FOLDER_DISTANCE, in exactly the order an

 *
 * The order is not incidental. Projection walks these pairs and mutates hues as
 * it goes, so a different sequence over the same pairs converges to different
 * colours. Any faster discovery has to reproduce the sequence element for
 * element, which is what the equivalence tests check.
 *
 * A uniform grid of exactly FOLDER_DISTANCE is what makes the shortcut safe: if
 * two entities are closer than that, neither their column nor their row indices
 * can differ by more than one, so the nine cells around an entity contain every
 * partner it could possibly have. The distance test itself is unchanged, so
 * boundary cases decide exactly as they did.
 *
 * Discovery was 146,070 distance tests at 128 clustered sets, for 4,003 pairs.
