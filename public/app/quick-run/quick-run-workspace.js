/**
 * Quick Run — the workspace binding: the composition seam between the surface and the workspace.
 *
 * The surface module knows how to paint a session and which key means which action; the workspace owns
 * navigation, launching and selection. This module is the one place the two meet, and it exists so the
 * meeting can be exercised without booting the app: the entry file passes the elements and its
 * collaborators, and a test can pass the production markup's elements, a real store and the real
 * `createWorkspaceCommands` and press the keys for real.
 *
 * That is not a refactor for its own sake. Before this module existed the wiring lived inside
 * `workspace-20260730b.js`, which boots from the document and cannot be imported - so every claim about
 * what Enter does had to be split in two: a test that re-implemented the entry's steps against the real
 * command object, and a source-shape assertion that the entry still contained those steps. A test that
 * re-implements the thing it is testing proves the copy, not the production line. Here the production line
 * *is* the module the test drives.
 *
 * Three rules it follows rather than invents:
 *
 * - **Re-read before acting (section 5).** Every key re-resolves the row by its stable result key against
 *   the current state. An index is a snapshot; the workspace moves under it, and a stale payload is never
 *   executed. When the re-read says the result is gone, the surface rebuilds its snapshot from the state
 *   that refused it - so the reader is shown what is true now instead of a row that will refuse again.
 * - **Name the workspace's own command (sections 1.5, 6.4).** Enter hands an item id to
 *   `commands.activateItem` - the same call workspace Enter makes - and Ctrl+Enter follows
 *   `planQuickRunReveal`, which never delegates to the host file manager. No second launcher is grown here.
 * - **Close on success, stay open on refusal (sections 16.1 and 16.2).** A refusal is something this module
 *   can see - the row is gone, the plan is deferred, no command applies - so it keeps the layer open and
 *   says why. What happens after a hand-off is the host's, and its failures reach the status line where
 *   they stay visible, so closing there is not a silent close.
 *
 * Shift+Enter (add to the active layout) is not bound here. It was cut rather than repaired: its only write
 * path installed state in memory without committing it, so a surface without document-write authority could
 * be told "added" after a refused write. This module no longer takes the store, the render callback or the
 * window-layout helpers, because nothing here needs them - which is also what makes the false-success path
 * unreachable rather than merely unused.
