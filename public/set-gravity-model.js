/** Sets as centres of gravity.
 *
 * A set is not a shape to be computed and then imposed on the layout. It is an
 * attraction: its members are pulled towards their common centre, so they
 * gather on their own, and whatever outline gets drawn is a consequence of
 * where they ended up rather than a constraint they had to obey.
 *
 * That order matters, and getting it backwards is expensive. Computing an
 * envelope first and then forcing positions to respect it means solving for a
 * shape that spans members wherever they happen to be — which needs connectors
 * between distant ones, and those connectors are thin, and thin connectors
 * pinch around whatever they pass. None of that arises here: members that
 * belong together are already near each other, so there is nothing to bridge.
 *
 * The graph already works this way. Every node is pulled to the viewport centre
 * at a low strength, repelled from every other, and held at a distance by its
 * links; the layout is the equilibrium of those. This adds one more term of the
 * same kind — a pull towards the set's own centre instead of only the global
 * one — rather than a different kind of rule layered on top.
 *
 * The centre is the members' own mean, so it moves as they do — a set drifts
 * with its members rather than being anchored anywhere.
 *
 * That alone does not stop it collapsing, though, and it is tempting to think
 * it does: as the members converge the centre stays among them and the pull
 * continues all the way to a single point. Measured in isolation, a three
 * member set contracts to a spread of zero. In the real graph the charge and
 * collision forces push back long before that, but a force that only behaves
 * because something else is holding it up is not one worth having, so the
 * attraction stops at a rest radius instead.
 *
 * No DOM, store, or browser APIs. */

/** Keeps the outlines of unrelated sets from crossing each other.
 *
 * Two sets sharing no members settled with their outlines crossing and the lens
 * between them holding no icons at all — a boundary drawn through empty space,
 * saying nothing true about either set.
 *
 * Nothing existed to prevent it. Ring nodes are given zero charge, so they do
 * not repel; collision separates node from node at 60px, which two rings can
 * satisfy while the curves drawn through them still overlap. No force acted
 * between two sets at all.
 *
 * Ring charge was the obvious lever and is the wrong one. It is global: a
 * charged ring node pushes on its own members and its own neighbours as well as
 * on other sets, which is why it was set to zero to begin with. Measured, it
 * also does not behave monotonically — -20 and -120 separate the rings where -60
 * still crosses — so any value that worked would be working by luck.
 *
 * This acts between whole sets in two ways, because there are two things that
 * can overlap and separating one does not separate the other.
 *
 * Ring nodes are pushed apart within a clearance, which keeps the physics from
 * interpenetrating. But what the user sees is the hull drawn around those
 * nodes, and a hull spans outward across any concavity — so two rings whose
 * every node is comfortably clear can still be *drawn* as two shapes that
 * overlap. Reported from a real scene: the physics no longer overlapped and the
 * rendering plainly did.
 *
 * So the drawn hulls are separated too, on the shape actually on screen rather
 * than on a proxy for it. That is the same principle as drawing and hit-testing
 * the hull: whatever the user is looking at is the thing that has to be
 * correct, so it is the thing the force reads.
 *
 * Sets that share a member are exempt, and that exemption is the point rather
 * than a special case: two sets with an item in common are *supposed* to
 * overlap, because the shared item is pulled towards both centres and has to sit
 * in the region belonging to both. Pushing those apart would break the Venn the
 * gravity force builds. Verified: with the exemption, a shared-member scene
 * still overlaps and its lens contains exactly the shared item.
 *
 * Separating the drawn hulls by moving ring nodes alone is not enough, and the
 * reason is an invariant rather than a tuning gap: the outline drawn on screen
 * is floored to enclose the members' own tiles, so when the members of two
 * unrelated sets rest close enough for those floored regions to overlap — held
 * there by graph links, or merely within the padding band — the visible shapes
 * overlap no matter what the ring nodes do. Measured on a large/small unrelated
 * pair with a graph link pinning the small set: the eased outline overlap
 * persisted at 78.6px with the ring-only impulse, and reached 0.0px once the
 * impulse also translated the members.
 *
 * So each set is treated as a droplet: the impulse moves the effective visible
 * member nodes and the ring nodes together, one uniform per-set delta, so the
 * collision response translates the droplet without changing its internal
 * offsets, hull area, or outline geometry. The impulse fires only while the
 * drawn outlines overlap and stops the moment they are disjoint, so it is
 * non-penetration, not a standing repulsion: internal attraction (a set's own
 * gravity) and external graph attraction (links, charge, exclusion) still act
 * and may bring two sets to rest beside each other, but their regions never
 * intersect.
 *
 * A set whose member is being dragged is anchored and takes no impulse at all —
 * members and ring alike, because moving its ring alone would tear the outline
 * away from the item under the pointer. The unheld droplet then absorbs the
 * full separation. If both droplets are anchored the pair is skipped: the
 * pointer wins, and the overlap persists only for as long as the drag does. */
