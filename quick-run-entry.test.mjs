// What Quick Run's keys are wired to, asserted where each half now lives.
//
// This file used to assert the wiring as source shape because the entry file cannot be imported here: it
// reads the document at load time and boots the whole workspace. That is still true of the entry, but the
// wiring has moved out of it - `public/app/quick-run/quick-run-workspace.js` is the composition seam, and
// `quick-run-workspace.test.mjs` drives it for real: production markup, a real store, the real command
// object, a typed query and a keypress. So the shape assertions here are about the seam's internals (which
// keys exist, which plan decides, that no second launcher was smuggled in) and about the one thing that is
// still entry-only: the element adapter that maps dom.js's registry keys onto the handles the surface takes.
