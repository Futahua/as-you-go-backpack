/** How much geometric work one overlapping component may cost before its exact
 * arrangement is abandoned for the layered fallback.
 *
 * This replaces the set-count ceiling that stood here. Cardinality was never
 * the thing that made a component expensive — geometry was. Over a 140-sample
 * corpus spanning 2 to 8 sets and five overlap densities
 * (set-region-work-calibration.mjs), correlation with elapsed time was:
 *
 *   clipping operations  r = 0.9984
 *   vertices processed   r = 0.9977
 *   fragments generated  r = 0.9946
 *   peak live fragments  r = 0.9337
 *   output vertices      r = 0.9312
 *   set count            r = 0.7338   <- the weakest predictor by a wide margin
 *
 * Only one dimension is enforced: several unrelated ceilings would be several
 * things to get wrong, and the rest of the ledger stays measured and available
 * for recalibration. Clips and vertices are statistically indistinguishable
 * here and both separate cleanly, but vertices also carries the size of what is
 * being clipped, so it stays honest if fragment complexity ever changes.
 * Fragment counts, by contrast, do NOT separate: at a 4ms target their safe and
 * over-budget ranges overlap, which is why peak live fragments is recorded for
 * allocation pressure but never used as the time gate.
 *
 * 210,000 is the <=4ms band: the highest vertex count that stayed within 4ms was
 * 200,577 and the lowest that exceeded it was 218,508, so the threshold sits in
 * a clean gap rather than splitting a contested range. Four milliseconds keeps
 * regions to about a quarter of a 16.7ms frame, leaving the rest for physics,
 * hue solving, effects and the DOM write.
 *
 * The consequence worth stating plainly, on production-resolution outlines: a
 * twelve-set sparse chain costs 152k vertices and stays exact, while a six-set
 * dense pile costs 536k and degrades. The old set-count rule would have rejected
 * the first and accepted the second. */
