/**
 * Quick Run — the launcher overlay's marker and its one event.
 *
 * The creator's correction, and it is the whole reason this module exists rather than the old one: Alt+A is a
 * LAUNCHER, not a window switcher. "they all work, but my idea of alt a is not to bring papers forward" -
 * the command surface appears on top of whatever application they are using, they type, they press Enter, it
 * vanishes, and the application they came from never loses its place. Papers does not come forward at all.
 *
 * So the host opens a 640x220 always-on-top window on this project's URL with a marker on it, and the
 * marker - not an event - is what says "you are the command surface now". There is no second page and no
 * second product: the same code serves the canvas, the in-app chord and this overlay, and the only thing the
 * marker changes is what is rendered and two rules about focus and Escape. Every divergence that remains is
 * named at its implementation, so two versions cannot drift apart quietly.
 *
 * The withdrawn contract is worth recording, because it had a subtly different shape: the host used to bring
 * Papers to the front and relay `papers:project:global-invoke`, so the project could only ever OPEN a surface
 * in a window the host had already raised. This one arrives in a window that already exists.

/**
 * WHY THE LAUNCHER HAS NO ITEMS — diagnosed, host-side, one gate. Read this before touching the load path.
 *
 * Measured on the creator's installed build (4a6120a), by making the failure say itself out loud in the
 * overlay: every project request from the launcher is refused with
 *
 *   Error invoking remote method 'host:backpack-project:state-load':
 *   Error: host channel called from non-host sender
 *
 * That is thrown in `src/main/ipc/hostIpc.ts` before the facade is reached, by a guard that admits a sender
 * when `isHostSender(sender)` OR `isBackpackProjectSender(sender)`. The launcher is neither. The predicate
 * behind the second (`src/main/backpacks/backpackSurfaceRegistry.ts`) admits exactly three things: the live
 * workspace frame, a sender in `detachRegistry` with kind `detached`, or a sender in `widgetRegistry` with
 * kind `compact-widget` — and the launcher window is registered in NEITHER registry. It is only bound to
 * `surfaceContexts` (by `bindOwnedProjectSurface(overlayWindow, projectId, 'widget', …)`), which is a
 * different registry, consulted by a different check (`requireProjectForSender`), and that check is reached
 * only after this guard has already thrown.
 *
 * What that means in full, because it is wider than the empty box:
 *   - `state-load` is refused, so the surface has no items to search (what the creator saw);
 *   - `launch-shortcut`, `copy-text`, `state-save-checked` and every other project request are refused by the
 *     same rule, so running a result from the launcher would fail even with the items in hand.
 *
 * So the bar the creator set — items appear AND are runnable — needs one host-side change: admit the
 * launcher's sender in `isAllowedProjectSurfaceSender` (a third registration kind alongside detached and
 * compact-widget, registered where the window is created). Nothing on this side can or should work around it:
 * a second store, a cached copy or a side channel would all be a second source of items, which is exactly
 * what the contract forbids. The retries this project does make (one bounded one at boot, one per invocation
 * while nothing has ever loaded) are the most this side can honestly do, and they mean the feature starts
 * working the moment that gate admits the sender — without anyone reopening the overlay.

 *
 * `projectId` and `surfaceId` are not consulted, for the reason measured earlier and still true: the
 * `surfaceId` the host sends is generated by the host (`sf-...`) and appears nowhere in a surface's own URL,
 * so a receiving surface cannot check it against itself. It does not need to here - the host opened this
 * window for this project, so an invocation arriving in it is for it.
 *
 * Escape is not handled here and must not be: the host dismisses the overlay from `before-input-event` on the
 * window, so that dismissal works even if this page is still loading. A second dismissal path in the page
 * would empty a window the host still has up.
