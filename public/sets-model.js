/** Pure data for item sets: named groupings over workspace items.
 *
 * A set is a record with an id, a title, and a member id list. An item may
 * belong to several sets (they overlap, forming a Venn) or to none. Sets are
 * independent of folder location — moving an item between folders never
 * changes what it belongs to.
 *
 * Sets have no stored position or size. Their outline is derived from where
 * their members happen to be, so nothing can desync: the shape is recomputed
 * from the members' current positions each time it is drawn. Spatially, a
 * non-member may not be dropped inside a set's region, and an item belonging
 * to several sets lives in their intersection — it cannot sit in the part of
 * one set the others do not cover, which is what keeps a Venn overlap
 * meaningful.
 *
 * A member id always refers to a workspace item, never to another set, so
 * there is no set-of-sets to traverse and no cycle to guard against. One set's
 * members can still all sit inside another's, which reads as nesting on
 * screen; that is just a total overlap, and falls out of allowing overlap at
 * all. Nothing in this module treats it specially.
 *
 * Membership is inherited through folders: a folder's contents belong to
 * whatever the folder belongs to, at any depth. Only the folder is stored, so
 * items added to it later join its sets automatically.
 *
 * A set therefore carries two lists. `memberIds` is what it contains;
 * `excludedIds` is what has been taken back out of an inherited subtree.
 * Without the second, "remove this item from the set" cannot be honoured for
 * an inherited item at all — the folder is the only thing stored, so the only
 * alternative would be expanding it into its contents, which loses the
 * property that makes inheritance worth having.
 *
 * No DOM, host, store, or browser events. */
