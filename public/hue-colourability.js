/** Deciding whether a proximity component can satisfy the hue separation at all.
 *
 * The hue constraint is exactly graph colouring. With a minimum separation of
 * 45 degrees there are 360/45 = 8 half-open sectors, and:
 *
 *   - an 8-colouring gives a feasible placement, by putting colour k at the
 *     centre of sector k, where any two adjacent entities are at least 45 apart;
 *   - any feasible placement gives an 8-colouring, by mapping each hue to the
 *     sector containing it, since two adjacent entities cannot share a sector
 *     when their hue distance must be at least the sector width.
 *
 * So "cannot be satisfied" means precisely "not 8-colourable", and nothing less
 * than that may be treated as proof. Size and density do not decide it: the
 * extremal 8-colourable graph on 17 vertices is the Turan graph T8(17), which
 * has exactly 126 edges — and a 17-vertex component with exactly 126 edges is
 * what this codebase actually observes. That component sits precisely on the
 * boundary and could be either.
 *
 * The verdict is deliberately three-valued. `unknown` is not a failure; it is
 * the honest answer when the bounded search has not decided, and callers must
 * treat it exactly as they treat `feasible`.
