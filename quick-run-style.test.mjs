// Quick Run's surface exists — and the two numbers its behaviour depends on agree with it.
//
// The feature shipped behaviourally complete and visually absent: no stylesheet in the tree mentioned any
// of its classes, so in the real host #quick-run-layer computed to a static, transparent, in-flow block at
// (0,0) while #graph-viewport was an absolutely positioned 1400x825 sibling painted above it. The rows were
// drawn and every pointer event at their coordinates hit the graph instead; measured with elementFromPoint
// and a real click, and invisible to the rest of the suite, because no other test reads a stylesheet.
//
// So this file holds what a later edit could break silently: that the surface has a stylesheet at all, that
// it is layered above the workspace content and below the menus, that the list can scroll (without which
// the wheel rule has nothing to scroll), that every class the surface paints has a rule, and that the row
// height the wheel arithmetic falls back to is the height the stylesheet actually draws.
