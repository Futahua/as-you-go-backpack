/**
 * Quick Run — what the surface draws, as data (section 1.2).
 *
 * Section 1.2 fixes the row's content and the list's shape, and this module is that mapping with no markup
 * and no selectors in it at all — the surface decides how to draw, this decides what:
 *
 * - every visible row carries an icon kind, a primary name and a faint trailing breadcrumb;
 * - **one flat list only**, no grouped sections;
 * - duplicate names are allowed and expected when breadcrumbs differ, so nothing here de-duplicates: two
 *   placements of one shortcut are two rows that happen to share a primary name;
 * - the **cap line** (below) is a sentence this module owns, so the surface paints a string it was handed
 *   rather than composing copy of its own, and the **no-matches line** is the same arrangement: a query
 *   that matches nothing says so instead of leaving a blank layer that reads like a stall.
 *
 * The icon is a *kind* rather than a glyph: the contract says a row has an icon, and glyph choice is
 * presentation, so the surface picks the picture from the kind it is given.

 * longer describes the row. That last part is section 10.5's reset rule and it is why an entry carries the
 * descriptor it was noted against rather than only the state: a member whose descriptor changed is a
 * different window as far as anything here can tell, so the prior answer must not survive it.
 *
 * The descriptor it carries is the one the model persists - `title` plus `executableFingerprint`, the
 * fields `descriptorIdentityKey` reads - and not the occurrence ids or the display name. An earlier version
 * of this function fingerprinted `layoutId + memberId + name`, which meant a member whose executable
 * fingerprint changed while its title stayed the same kept the answer that belonged to a different window.
