// Ephemeral availability: what is known about a layout item after something asked (section 10.1).
//
// The rule this file holds is narrow on purpose. Availability is never persisted, an untouched item is
// `unknown`, and a noted answer survives only while the descriptor it was noted against still describes
// the row - because a member whose descriptor changed is a different window as far as the surface can
// tell, which is section 10.5's reset. Whether the live resolution and activation ever happen is a
// separate question and is not claimed here.
