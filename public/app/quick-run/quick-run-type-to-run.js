/**
 * Quick Run — type-to-run: the third way in, and the cheapest one.
 *
 * The creator's ruling: once they are inside the Papers canvas, typing is enough. A printable character
 * pressed on the canvas opens the palette with that character **already in the line** — the character that
 * opened it is the first thing in the query, exactly once. The chord stays for reaching Quick Run from
 * elsewhere, and the globally wired chords stay too; this is only for the reader who is already looking at
 * the canvas.
 *
 * Two rules give the feature its shape.
 *
 * **The bindings in force win, always.** This module never carries a list of today's keys. It asks the
 * hotkey model what is bound *including the creator's overrides* - `effectiveBindings` already answers
 * that - and a printable character that any workspace binding claims belongs to that binding and does its
 * action. It keeps working the day a shortcut is moved back onto a bare letter, because nothing here was
 * written down: the answer comes from state.
 *
 * **Typing means typing.** Four states keep their keys: a focused field, a live inline editor (the graph's
 * set-name editor is a `.set-name-editor`), an open dialog, and an IME composition. The first three are
 * the states where a character is already going somewhere; the fourth is the one that can destroy work,
 * and it is refused rather than served - see the note on composing below.
 *
 * This module decides, and nothing else: it reads an event-like object and the facts the caller already
 * has, and answers `open` with the seed or `pass` with the reason. It does not touch the DOM, the session
 * or the state.

 *
 * A composing keystroke never opens the palette, and that is the deliberate choice the creator asked for:
 * opening would move focus out from under the composition, and a half-composed character committed into a
 * line that has just replaced its owner is worse than a gesture that did not fire. The cost is real and is
 * recorded rather than hidden: with nothing focused on the canvas there is no text field for a composition
 * to belong to, so a character composed there is lost either way - but it is not mangled, and the palette
 * does not appear in the middle of the creator's word.
 *
 * Not verifiable in this repository's disposable host: a real OS-level Vietnamese IME (UniKey, or the
 * Windows Telex layout) drives composition through the platform's text services, which no headless run can
 * install or press. What is verified is the browser's own composition path, driven through Chromium's IME
 * entry point; see the host probe.
