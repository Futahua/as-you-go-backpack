/**
 * 019C (RoketPuncha sole-editor lane): the workspace-side durable writers the
 * entry wires. The workspace is the SOLE durable writer; these factories only
 * mutate through the injected model/commit hooks and never touch the widget
 * channel or recording persistence directly.
 *
 * - createWindowLayoutPickApplier: applies Winter's one typed committed pick
 *   set - every remove data-only, every successful add capability/descriptor -
 *   and persists ONCE through commitState. Cancel is byte-zero. Partial add
 *   failures are counted, never fatal.
 * - createWindowLayoutRetirementWriter: applies Ning's onRetireMember intent to
 *   one data-only removal/save; ignores the intent when the member or layout no
 *   longer exists. Never persists counters.
 *
 * 040: every capability/icon cache entry is keyed by the composite
 * `layoutId\u0000memberId` identity (the same key the pure runtime uses), so a
 * member cached for one layout never leaks into another layout that happens to
 * reference the same real window. The key function is injected so the entry and
 * these writers provably agree on one composite identity.

 * What a committed pick result is worth, as two answers the caller must not conflate.
 *
 * `mutated` - did anything actually change? A pick whose removals were all refused (no member carried the
 * descriptor, or two did) and whose adds all failed changes nothing, and the caller must treat it as nothing:
 * it must not tell the widget channel a layout was committed, and above all it must not ensure recording,
 * because that is what ACTIVATES a layout, persists it as the recording context, and applies real windows.
 * A pure refusal that activated a layout the creator was not using would be a side effect of a no-op.
 *
 * `statusText` - what to say. The old wording asserted "nothing was removed" whenever a removal was refused,
 * which is false the moment some removals in the same array succeeded. It is now decided by `removed`:
 * nothing removed says so, a partial result reports both halves.
