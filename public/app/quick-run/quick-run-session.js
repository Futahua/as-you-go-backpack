/**
 * Quick Run — the session: what is open, what is typed, what is shown, what is highlighted.
 *
 * This is section 1.1's behaviour as a pure state machine, with no markup at all. The surface that draws
 * it is a later stage, and the rules here are the ones the contract fixes in as many words:
 *
 * - opening shows one **empty** line, no result rows, filter All, no highlight — there is no
 *   empty-query home screen, so an empty query shows nothing rather than everything;
 * - results first appear after the first non-empty query;
 * - Escape closes the session and leaves **no** result action behind: closing produces a closed session
 *   and nothing else, so no create/move/launch/select/navigate/persist can ride along with it;
 * - closing clears the query, the highlight, the rows and the filter — a reopened session starts empty
 *   rather than resuming a previous search.
 * - the rows it holds are **at most QUICK_RUN_MAX_PAINTED_ROWS of the matches**, because one keystroke can
 *   rank thousands of them and the surface paints every row it is handed. `totalRows` keeps the honest match
 *   count and `capped` says the list on screen is a prefix of it.
 *
 * The rows it narrows are the ones quick-run-search.js builds, ranked by quick-run-index.js, filtered by
 * quick-run-types.js: this module owns only the session around them.

/**
 * How many matches one session may hold — and therefore how many rows the surface may paint at once.
 *
 * This is a measured number, not a taste. `quick-run-integrated-perf.mjs` (STAGE 14.1/14.2's acceptance
 * instrument) measures keystroke-to-results-DOM-commit latency in the real renderer on a synthetic
 * 20,000-occurrence workspace, and groups the samples by how many rows that commit painted:
 *
 * ```
 *   1-200         p95  2.6-6.1 ms    0 samples over one frame
 *   201-1,000     p95 10.8 ms        0 over
 *   1,001-3,000   p95 23.7 ms        8 over
 *   3,001-12,000  p95 58.2 ms       30 of 30 over
 *   12,001+       p95 47.8 ms        6 over
 * ```
 *
 * The contract's gate is p95 <= 16 ms, and the surface paints every row `quickRunRowViews` maps, so the
 * cost of a keystroke is set by the size of the ranked result set rather than by the query. One keystroke
 * really does reach four figures: the fuzzy subsequence tier (quick-run-index.js) matches a single letter
 * against a large slice of a 20k corpus — "a" for the query "archive d" is 12,213 rows. 200 is the largest
 * bucket that is honestly inside the budget: it measured p95 6.1 ms, leaving roughly 2.6x margin for a busy
 * machine, where 201-1,000 is already at 10.8 ms and 1,001-3,000 misses outright.
 *
 * The cap is applied at the session rather than in the DOM layer because `rows` is the single thing three
 * consumers share: what the surface paints, what `quickRunSessionAfterArrow` walks, and what the highlight
 * is chosen from. Bounding it here bounds all three together, so navigation cannot step past the painted
 * list and a highlight can never land on a row that is not on screen. Nothing else is capped: `chipsFor`
 * still sees every match, the filter-fallback rule still sees every match, and activation still revalidates
 * by stable result key against the current workspace state (quick-run-activation.js).
