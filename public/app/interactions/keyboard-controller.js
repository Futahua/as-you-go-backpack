 * A control that TYPING goes into - the narrower question type-to-run has to ask.
 *
 * The two are not the same, and the difference was measured rather than assumed: `#backdrop-opacity-slider`
 * is an `input[type=range]`, it matches the editable selector, and with it focused a letter did nothing at
 * all - not the slider's, and (before this) not type-to-run's either. A slider takes no text, so it is not a
 * place where typing means typing, and the feature has to keep working there.
 *
 * The exclusions are the input types that cannot hold text, and the list is written as exclusions on
 * purpose: an input type not named here still counts as a text control, so an unfamiliar one fails towards
 * "refuse to open" rather than towards stealing a keystroke from a field. The wider EDITABLE_SELECTOR is
 * unchanged, so every other workspace key behaves exactly as it did.
 *
 * It is one plain string, and that matters: this selector is only checked by a CSS engine, and the node
 * harness has none. Two wrong shapes were built here first - a bare `:not(...)` list item, which also
 * matches body and so treated every keystroke as typing, and an array joined with the empty string, which
 * fused `textarea` onto the end of the last `:not()` and made the whole list invalid. `Element.matches()`
 * throws on an invalid selector, which kills the keydown handler quietly: in the host the feature simply
 * never appeared. Do not build this string; keep it literal, and keep the shape test below honest.
