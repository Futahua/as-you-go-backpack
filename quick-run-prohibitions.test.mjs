// network, a native call, an observer, a timer, a worker, a thumbnail, an embedding, a dependency - and
// then names, one line per prohibition, which of these scans or which behavioural test holds it. If a
// later pass adds any of those facilities, the first test fails and the box that promised its absence has
// to be re-opened rather than quietly kept.
