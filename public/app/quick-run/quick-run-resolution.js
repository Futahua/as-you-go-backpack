// Resolving a Layout Item to a live window, as a decision rather than a call (section 10).

// The contract draws a hard line here and this module is that line: resolution either finds exactly one
// window, or it reports missing or ambiguous - it never picks a plausible substitute, and it never
// activates anything. The native half (asking the host for the windows, then raising or restoring one)
// waits for a session at the machine and for the Papers-side capability; what can be built and tested now
// is the decision, which is where "never silently substitutes" actually lives.
//
// Matching is fail-closed: only the descriptor fields the member declares are compared, every one of them
// must match exactly, and a descriptor that declares nothing matches nothing. A near-miss is a miss.
