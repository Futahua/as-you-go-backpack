/**
 * What a member card says when the surface cannot confirm its window.
 *
 * Until now a member the widget could not confirm looked exactly like a healthy one. The removal path that
 * used to fire on that state is gone (see window-layout-runtime.js), so the member is held; the card has to
 * say so, and say it in words the creator reads rather than in ours.
 *
 * There is deliberately ONE note, not two. The brief asked for "cannot check right now" to be distinguished
 * from "definitely gone", and the honest reading of the host is that nothing can produce the second: GONE
 * requires positive terminal evidence, no host outcome carries it, and the match that fails can fail on a
 * changed title alone. A card state the code cannot reach is a state that cannot be tested, so it is not
 * invented here - if the host ever gains a terminal outcome, this is the file that grows a second note.
