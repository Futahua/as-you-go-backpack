/**
 * Quick Run — the surface: the layer, the line, the chips, the flat result list and its two sentences.
 *
 * The module owns the elements the page declares (#quick-run-layer, -input, -chips, -results, and the two
 * lines -cap and -notice) and paints them from a session. It draws nothing the contract has not decided:
 * section 1.2's row content (icon kind, primary name, faint trailing breadcrumb, one flat list) and section
 * 1.4's chips come from quick-run-presentation.js as data, and this module only turns that data into nodes.
 *
 * Four rules it does not invent:
 *
 * - **The input is the reader's while they are typing.** The value is set from the session when the
 *   session's query is empty (opening and closing), and never while a query is live — a repaint that
 *   overwrote what someone was typing would be the surface fighting the person using it.
 * - **Keys are stable and semantic**, so a later acceptance test can name a row without depending on
 *   order: data-quick-run-key carries the row's resultKey, data-quick-run-highlighted marks the one row
 *   the session highlighted, data-quick-run-chip marks an active chip, and data-quick-run-cap is `true`
 *   exactly while the cap line is on screen.
 * - **The highlight travels with the scroll.** Section 6.3 leaves the list to scroll normally, and the
 *   other half of that sentence is that the selection must not be left behind: the wheel moves the
 *   highlight by the rows it scrolled — accumulating the device's deltas, in whatever unit it reports them,
 *   until a whole row of travel has arrived — and a highlight *moved* by the keyboard, the wheel or a
 *   refresh is brought back into view. Typing is deliberately not in that set: a new query is a new list and
 *   starts at its own top, where its first row already is, and touching the scroll box on every keystroke
 *   forces the layout the paint cap exists to keep out of the keystroke (measured: forcing it there took the
 *   integrated harness from p95 4.3 ms to 8.1 ms). The list's own scroll event feeds that same bookkeeping,
 *   so a dragged scrollbar counts as the reader having scrolled.
 * - **Fractional wheel travel belongs to one baseline.** A row moves on the *sum* of the travel a gesture has
 *   delivered, which means something has to hold the remainder between events — and something has to throw it
 *   away when the list, the highlight or the scroll position is replaced by anything other than the wheel.
 *   Every such operation does: typing, arrows, Tab, a refresh, opening and closing. The awkward case is a
 *   manual scroll (a dragged scrollbar, a touch scroll), because the wheel's own scrolling arrives as scroll
 *   events too — and, measured in the host, a *single* 20 px wheel produces five of them, so counting scroll
 *   events against wheel events does not work. A press on the list is the signal that distinguishes them: the
 *   wheel has no pointer, and a press marks the scroll it causes even when it is released before that scroll
 *   arrives (a track click, measured at 2 ms of press followed by its scroll).
 * - **Nothing is drawn for a state that has nothing to say.** An empty query shows no home screen, an
 *   uncapped list shows no cap line, and a query that matches draws the no-matches line rather than a
 *   blank layer that reads like a stall.
 *
 * Shift+Enter is not handled here: the gesture was cut with its plan (see quick-run-activation.js).
