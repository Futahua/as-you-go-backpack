/**
 * Diagnostic ring buffer for layout membership changes.
 *
 * Why this exists: the creator can add one window and several other icons
 * disappear in the same moment - a closed-window sweep, a startup reconcile, or
 * a suppressed instance. The saved state only shows the result, so the last few
 * changes are recorded WITH the reason and the member count on each side of the
 * change, and kept inside the workspace document so the sequence can be read
 * afterwards by whoever is asked to explain it.
 *
 * Bounded to the last few entries, data-only: nothing reads it back and no
 * behaviour depends on it.
