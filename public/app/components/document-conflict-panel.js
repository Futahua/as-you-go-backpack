/**
 * 0B: what the creator sees when a save was refused.
 *
 * The board changed somewhere else before this surface's change could save.
 * Both versions exist and only the creator can say which should survive, so
 * this panel states that plainly and offers exactly two ways out. It is
 * deliberately NOT modal: the conflict is not an interruption to dismiss, it is
 * a state the surface stays in, and reading, navigating and copying remain
 * available while it is up.
 *
 * The confirmation belongs on "Keep my version" alone, because that is the one
 * action that can erase work saved elsewhere. Choosing the latest version only
 * discards this surface's unsaved change, which is the creator's own and is
 * still on screen in front of them.
 *
 * No JSON, no revisions and no code are shown. The creator does not resolve
 * this by reading a document.
