 *     existing fragment inside S    ->  its membership plus S

 * stays convex. intersectConvex returns a convex lens and subtractConvex returns
 * a partition into convex pieces, so the two primitives already proven in
 * set-region-model remain the only Boolean operations involved — no
 * general-purpose polygon library, and no non-convex clipping.
 *
